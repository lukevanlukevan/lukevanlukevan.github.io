Table of Contents support is based on [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc).

If you use the `post-toc` layout, a table of contents will be automatically generated based on all `##` headings - this is defined by `h_max=2` in `_layouts/post-toc.html` file, which you can change to fit your need.

The following is an example:

## Python Basics

### Math Operators

From **Highest** to **Lowest** precedence:

| Operators | Operation         | Example         |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| \*\*      | Exponent          | `2 ** 3 = 8`    |
| %         | Modulus/Remainder | `22 % 8 = 6`    |
| //        | Integer division  | `22 // 8 = 2`   |
| /         | Division          | `22 / 8 = 2.75` |
| \*        | Multiplication    | `3 * 3 = 9`     |
| -         | Subtraction       | `5 - 2 = 3`     |
| +         | Addition          | `2 + 2 = 4`     |
