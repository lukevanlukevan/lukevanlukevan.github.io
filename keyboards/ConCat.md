I have a specific usecase for keyboards as I am a 3D designer/animator by trade, so I use a _lot_ of modifier combos in my day to day use. Specifically, having anything tap-hold on a `KC_SPC` doesn't work, so I had to make changes and essentially have another thumb key compared to a typical split 3x6_3 layout.
I was playing around with [Keyboard Layout Editor](www.keyboard-layout-editor.com) making some funky layouts.
