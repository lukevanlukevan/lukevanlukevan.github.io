I have a specific usecase for keyboards as I am a 3D designer/animator by trade, so I use a _lot_ of modifier combos in my day to day use. Specifically, having anything tap-hold on a `KC_SPC` doesn't work, so I had to make changes and essentially have another thumb key compared to a typical split 3x6_3 layout.
I was playing around with [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com) making some funky layouts.

For me there is always a little bit of form over function, so I opted for no rotations and no gaps, that being said, here are the opdtions I created:

I decided on using the second one. Built out in KLE it looks like this:

With that figured out, I decided to do a really silly thing and connect my 2 split halves with 2 RJ45 cables. I wanted to try out a single controller and not have to faff with double flashing etc. I ordered a 4pack of connectors + breakout boards, and 2 0.5m cables.

## Plate

First up was printing the plate, after that I can get a test working. My go-to method is taking the KLE file to the [ai03 Plate Generator](https://kbplate.ai03.com/) and downloading the SVG from there, and then taking that to [text](https://dev.cog.ooo/svg2step/) and saving that. From there I can opern it in Plasticity. I offset the edges by half of the distance beween switches, and cleaned up the space around the 2u key. With that done, I ended up with this:

## Case

After some loose work to get all the pieces together, I built the case file to get ready for 3D printing. I utilized the space above the 2u key to fit my RJ45 ports and the controller
