# LV16

My first attempt at making anything handwired. Armed with a terrible soldering iron, a busted ethernet cable, and a ProMicro clone, I started building this thing.

# Plate

I download the a plate from [Joe Scotto's](www.github.com/joe-scatto) and used it as a base shape to build out a 4x4 macro pad. It uses a great idea for a 1.5mm depth for the switch to clip into, and then a further 1.5mm with wider holes to avoid the switch clips.

# Soldering

With barely any clue, I clicked the switches in, stripped wire segments from some of the ethernet cable and started soldering the columns.
