My first attempt at making anything handwired. Armed with a terrible soldering iron, a busted ethernet cable, and a ProMicro clone, I started building this thing.

# Plate

I download the a plate from [Joe Scotto's](https://www.github.com/joe-scatto) and used it as a base shape to build out a 4x4 macro pad. It uses a great idea for a 1.5mm depth for the switch to clip into, and then a further 1.5mm with wider holes to avoid the switch clips.

# Soldering

With barely any clue, I clicked the switches in, stripped wire segments from some of the ethernet cable and started soldering the columns.

When it came to the rows, I just stripped bits of the ethernet cable and got this working as a proof of concept.

# Firmware

I skipped the QMK business and went straight to Vial porting.

Pretty boring but you can view the code in my [Vial Fork](https://www.github.com/lukevanlukevan/vial-qmk/keyboards/lv16)

One thing I did wrong was code the order of the columns in reverse, so the correct order when the keycaps are away from you. Not realizing this, I manually rewrote the matrix with the column index reversed. Whoops!
